# Sun Lo Na 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Halfbaked


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aneena Cherian - Model Engineering College
- Member 2: Gowri Nandana - Model Engineering College

### Project Description
"Sun Lo Na" is an intelligent music listener that plays your uploaded track only when you look directly at the camera. If you turn away, the music pauses — because this player wants your full attention. It also judges your music taste with playful feedback using AI.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People dare to play music… and not even look at it. Music feels ignored, unseen, unloved. It wants attention. Your Spotify never cared if you were present — but we do.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Sun Lo Na — a music listener that demands eye contact. Look away? The music stops. Look straight? It vibes with you. As a bonus, it even throws shade (or praise) at your music taste using AI. Because your playlist deserves to be judged.

### 🟢 Face Detected – Music Plays and Judgement Begins

*When the user looks directly at the camera, face detection is successful and music starts playing.  
It also judges the music you picked and gives a playful comment on your taste.*

### 🔴 Face Not Detected – Music Pauses
